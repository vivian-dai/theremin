## Background
I'm too poor to make a [pyrophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrophone) and too incompetent at physics to design an [ocarina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocarina) so here I am.... making a [theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin).

## Setup
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary libraries
2. Look through [`config.yml`](./config.yml) and set any variables you may want set

## Run
